          Christian Bale and director Christopher Nolan reunite following their
          blockbuster success with Batman Begins! This time, Heath Ledger joins
          the cast as The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart stars as Harvey Dent in an
          all-new adventure of The Dark Knight. With the help of Lieutenant Jim
          Gordon (Gary Oldman) and new district attorney Harvey Dent
          (Eckhart--Thank You for Smoking), Batman sets out to destroy organized
          crime in Gotham City forever. The three enjoy early success, but they
          soon find themselves prey to a rising criminal mastermind known as The
          Joker (Ledger--Brokeback Mountain), who throws Gotham into anarchy and
          forces Batman ever closer to crossing the line between hero and
          vigilante.
